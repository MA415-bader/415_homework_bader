## Strawberry data analysis

We make a separate R script and connect it to our quarto document so as to keep things organized and clean

```{r}
source("hw1_functions.R")
```

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(dplyr)

```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
strawberry <- read.csv("strawb_mar6.csv")

```

First we start by cleaning the data. The first step here is to split our data into two tables, census and survey

```{r}
census_data <- strawberry %>%
  filter(Program == "CENSUS")

survey_data <- strawberry %>%
  filter(Program == "SURVEY")

```

After making the function to drop columns that have less than one unique value, we implement it here:

```{r}
census_data <- census_data %>%
  drop_single_value_col()

survey_data <- survey_data %>%
  drop_single_value_col()

 

```

```{r}

```
