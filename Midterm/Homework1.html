<p>First we start by cleaning the data. The first step here is to split our data into two tables, census and survey</p>
<div class="cell">

</div>
<p>After making the function to drop columns that have less than one unique value, we implement it here:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb21"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb21-1"><a href="#cb21-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>census_data <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> census_data <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span></span>

<section id="census-data-cleaning" class="level1">
<h1>Census Data cleaning</h1>
<p>Reviewing the number of unique values for each column, we notice a few issues. For starters, the “Commodity” column has only two unique values, INCOME, NET CASH FARM and STRAWBERRIES. This feels really redundant; the entire data set is regarding strawberries, there is no confusion on that, and the “INCOME, NET CASH FARM” is messy jargon that is already referenced in other columns. hence, we can drop that column.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb22"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb22-1"><a href="#cb22-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">sapply</span>(census_data, <span class="cf">function</span>(col) <span class="fu">length</span>(<span class="fu">unique</span>(col)))  <span class="co">#checking for reference</span></span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>

</div>
</div>
<p>Next, we notice a few redundancies in domain and domain category in the census data, they are often repetitive. lets mutate by removing the repetition. Luckily, they all, while different, have the same format of taking the domain + “:” + code.</p>
<div class="cell">

</div>
<p>The census data has two different commodities, income, and strawberry data. while the strawberry data itself doesn’t have a lot of data points, we can further organize by splitting them into two different datasets as we did with survey and census.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb25"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb25-1"><a href="#cb25-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>income_data <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> census_data <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span> </span>

</div>
<p>Lets continue more cleaning, we really dont need the state ANSI, and because our project focus is regarding California and Florida, we remove rows for all other states as well.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb26"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb26-1"><a href="#cb26-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>straw_data <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> straw_data <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span></span>

</div>
<p>lets also remove any state other than California and Florida, as they are our focal point of study</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb27"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb27-1"><a href="#cb27-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>straw_data <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> straw_data <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span></span>

<p>now that the tables are split, lets use our function again to drop single value columns.</p>

</div>
<p>Now our table looks much cleaner, the years were both removed, as the strawberry data was only for 2021 and income was for 2022. commodity was removed due to its redundancy as well. Data.item carries a good amount of information that already makes up for the loss of the columns.</p>

<p>The code above does a few things, it splits the data.item column, we use the dash as help in this case. I decided to create new columns, naming them commodity, organic_status (yes to all), and market_type. ultimately, there will be NA values as not all of them have same type of information in the data.item column, but now, to me at least, it is much cleaner looking regardless and is more understandable.</p>
<p>Now, lets do something similar to income_data.</p>

<p>note that two columns were removed, the pre_dash one was only used as part of the code, while the unit info was empty and not needed anyways as the dollar symbol itself is already present in income values</p>

<p>We could, in theory, split the table based on the domain, but we really don’t have enough data to do so, meaning we will work with this table as is.</p>
<p>Moving on, the first outliequarto render report.qmdr I see is the data.item field. lets list all of its unique values so we can identify how to split.</p>

<p>given the unique values in the data.item column, lets go for a similar approach as before in splitting:</p>

</div>
<p>Again, as this is a strawberry data table, we really don’t need a whole column (commodity) to mention that. We can remove it as it is the only value in that column. We can use our function again.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb41"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb41-1"><a href="#cb41-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>survey_data <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> survey_data <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span></span>
<span id="cb41-2"><a href="#cb41-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="fu">drop_single_value_col</span>()</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Finally, lets try to keep the number of columns consistent, We can easily cut down some columns that are unnecessary:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb42"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb42-1"><a href="#cb42-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>survey_data <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> survey_data <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span></span>
<span id="cb42-2"><a href="#cb42-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="fu">select</span>(<span class="sc">-</span> <span class="st">"Domain"</span>)</span>
<span id="cb42-3"><a href="#cb42-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb42-4"><a href="#cb42-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>straw_data <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> straw_data <span class="sc">%&gt;%</span></span>
<span id="cb42-5"><a href="#cb42-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="fu">select</span>(<span class="sc">-</span> <span class="st">"market_type"</span>) </span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
</div>
<p>In this case, Domain does not tell us anything that the category doesn’t say, and market_type has no meaning and is mostly missing anyways. Seems like we are pretty much done with cleaning, anything more than this and we run the risk of “over cleaning” our data, making it too simple for any interesting visualization. Here is a display of all three tables I made:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb43"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb43-1"><a href="#cb43-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">datatable</span>(income_data, <span class="at">options =</span> <span class="fu">list</span>(<span class="at">pageLength =</span> <span class="dv">5</span>, <span class="at">scrollX =</span> <span class="cn">TRUE</span>, <span class="at">autoWidth =</span> <span class="cn">TRUE</span>)) <span class="co">#interactive, feels very intuitive. i like the search feature.</span></span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>

<p>After checking data types. We notice that columns like Value is interpreted as a character, not a number. the final step in cleaning now is to normalize and fix data types for processing. In our case, I use gsub which will help remove commas from value and save it as a numeric value. As this will be repeated, I decided to code a function that:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Changes letter valued (D,H, etc…) to NA, then converts column to numeric</li>
</ol>

</div>
<p>With the code above, i filtered the chemicals (made sure to group values as numeric while also excluding the letter values, some of which we can’t use as they are withheld for privacy reasons I assume. Next, i listed the top 10 chemicals used. With this information, my objective is to pick the top 5 chemicals, i picked a slide head of 10 so as to avoid using the “total” values. based on the data, I will use these chemicals:</p>
<p>California:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>CHLOROPICRIN</p></li>
<li><p>DICHLOROPROPENE</p></li>
<li><p>SULFUR</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Florida:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>CAPTAN</p></li>
<li><p>THIRAM</p></li>
<li><p>CYPRODINIL</p></li>
</ol>
<p>now lets adjust naming conventions and some small cleaning before moving to visualizing:</p>

<p>This looks interesting. In prior iterations, I made it such that it picked the top 5 used chemicals in all states, which was problematic as it had heavily biased data towards California, mainly due to Florida having more NA and redacted values. So picking the top 3 from each state was the right call in my view. I used plotly here to create an interactive bar chart, you are able to specifically select either state to highlight, and hovering over the lines gives some more information on the exact value.</p>
<p>Looking at this visual, we see very minimal data in the applications section, so we can mostly disregard it for now. Lets start off with CHLOROPICRIN, which has a fairly high average value of over 50; According to the CDS, this substance causes eye irritation and is often used in tear gas and as a chemical warfare agent, which I see as concerning. the CDS also has studies on Dichloropropenes, which have been found to cause chest pain irritation, coughing, and erosion of stomach lining. finally, Sulfur seems to be, according to my research and the Environmental protection agency (EPA), the safest of the three in use. It has a low toxicity and has little risk to human health. Moreover, the EPA also studied its environmental and ecological effects and made the conclusion that it does not cause too much adverse effects.</p>
<p>Moving on to Florida, the clear winner here is CAPTAN, a fungicide, which can cause illness by inhalation, skin absorption, or consumption. It can cause irritation of eyes, skin, upper respiratory system, and vomiting. Thiram is a fungicide, it has moderate toxicity by ingestion, but highly toxic if inhaled; chronic or repeated exposure may have negative effects on liver and thyroid. finally, Cyprodinil, a fungicide, generally has low toxicity, but it is important to note the limited research on it, which is a common factor with most chemicals in this list.</p>

<p>Looking at the data and top 3, it is evident that California relies mostly on Fumigants, while Florida on Fungicides, highlighting the possible need for each in both states. Below is a table I created for the top 3 chemicals in both states along with their type.</p>

<p>California has more of a dry climate, which promotes the growth of pests in the soil, which is why fumigation is used more often. Florida, on the other hand, is humid and wet, which gives rise to fungal diseases, which is they more often use fungicides.</p>

<p>The results are not surprising at all. When you are able to use chemicals, you do not need to worry about having constant maintenance to stop bugs and disease, whereas with organic strawberries, you need a more hands-on approach in cultivation, meaning less acres. It is also worth noting that the organic strawberries data is VERY limited, only having 13 rows of data.</p>

<p>This is hard to read to be frank, but this is mainly due to the limited data. what this shows is two things:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Florida has a much higher Coefficient of variation (CV)</p></li>
<li><p>California has a downward slope, meaning that as sales increase, the variation decreases, leading to more predictable results. although, we can also argue that it is an outlier as the line is flat, meaning we have little to no relationship. Again, its really difficult to analyze with the limited data.</p></li>

<p>This visual is interesting, it clearly shows California is dominant when it comes to income over time. What I find most interesting is that the trends are nearly identical. I would have expected slightly differing trends, due to the nature of the different climates, but clearly This shows otherwise. Here are possible reasons in my opinion:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>2020: This is really low likely due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which heavily disrupted supply chains and caused a reduction in labor and a fluctuation in demand.</p></li>
<li><p>2021: This to me seems like a result of the post-pandemic recovery period, which led to stronger consumer demands and the opening of food industries and increased exports after the regulations eased.</p></li>
<li><p>2022: This is a tricky one to analyze. it could be due to lack of data, but also could be due to inflation and economic instability. I have little information about weather patterns to judge if that is relevant, meaning this needs further research.</p></li>
<li><p>2023: This might suggest that the markets are strengthening, possibly better weather for farming, or even more investments. Again, like 2022, its hard to answer this without more data.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Lets now move to analyzing the income data:</p>

<p>While slightly looking convoluted, this does tell us that Florida has a higher coefficient of variation (CV) in this case. The higher variability could also be an outlier.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Based on the analysis of the strawberry data, we got a comprehensive view of the data regarding California and Florida. The findings show a good amount of interesting information regarding the trends. Through the use of visuals, My main objective was to not simply analyze a specific research question, but to showcase the many interpretations one can achieve from looking at the data. From this project, It is clear to me that merely having data may not be enough, and making over-generalizations can hinder our understanding of the information; Which is why I added a lot of my personal opinion on what the data means and the reasoning, because we cannot know for certain.</p>

<p>In the future, I hope to gather more data that can be related to farming and crop analysis. I found myself wanting to know weather pattern data, farmland numbers, disease emergence in crops, etc…. This would further help me find interesting features and correlations (if any) within the data.</p>

<p>chatGPT: asked for some help on splitting, i explained my issue and it gave me this:</p>
<p>data &lt;- data %&gt;% separate(“column_name”, c(“pre_dash”, “post_dash”), ” - “, extra =”merge”, fill = “right”) %&gt;% separate(“pre_dash”, c(“col1”, “col2”, “col3”, etc…), “,”, extra = “merge”, fill = “right”) %&gt;% mutate( col1 = str_trim(col1), col2 = str_trim(col2), col3 = str_trim(col3) ) %&gt;% separate(“post_dash”, c(“col4”, “col5”), “,”, extra = “merge”, fill = “right”) %&gt;% mutate( col4 = str_trim(col4), col5 = str_trim(col5), col5 = str_remove(col5, “MEASURED IN”) )</p>
<p>I avoid giving it much information as i don’t want a direct answer.</p>
<p>also, I did use chatgpt do debug errors i got, never gave my code, just gave the error and asked why and what can cause it.</p>
