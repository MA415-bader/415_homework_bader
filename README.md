## homework repo

This repository contains all my assignments for MA415.

## Assignments:
- **homework0:** Folder which contains quarto script for city data visualizations, the folder also contains the visuals png
- **Midterm:** Folder containing all midterm items, HTML, pdf, quarto document, R project, functions.r, and images. note: I HIGHLY recommend viewing using the HTML as I have interactive plots that do NOT work in pdf, moreover, the visuals seem to bug out in the pdf. Tables should be in the folder named "Tables" inside the midterm folder. Note that some tables were not uploaded, they were mostly used for creating visuals or subsets.

- **Final Project:** Folder containing a fodler names "Shiny test". "Shiny test" contains everything pertaining to the final assignment, including the datasets, images, r script, and rpoj files.
