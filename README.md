## homework repo

This repository contains all my assignments for MA415.

## Assignments:
- **homework0:** Folder which contains quarto script for city data visualizations, the folder also contains the visuals png
- **Midterm:** Folder containing all midterm items, HTML, pdf, quarto document, R project, functions.r, and images. note: I HIGHLY recommend viewing using the HTML as I have interactive plots that do NOT work in pdf, moreover, the visuals seem to bug out in the pdf. As for tables, I could not manually upload them unfortunately, I hope that running the R code would suffice.
